## 📁 Projects related to System Analysis

### Project 1: HelpDeskNodeJS
- 📝 **Description**:  
  Designed and analyzed a Help Desk Ticketing System with a built-in Knowledge Base. This project aims to simulate a real-world IT support scenario where users can submit tickets, and admins/technicians can track and resolve issues efficiently.

- 📌 **Deliverables**:
  - Use Case Diagram
  - User Flow Diagram
  - Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
  - Mock UAT Test Cases

- 🔍 **Analysis Tasks Performed**:
  - Identified key actors: User, Admin, Technician
  - Mapped user journeys and system interactions
  - Created realistic UAT test cases to simulate end-user behavior
  - Validated workflows to ensure alignment with business needs

- 📂 **Tools**:
  - Draw.io, StarUML (Diagrams)
  - Google Docs (Documentation)

## 📂 Open Source or Practice Projects

### Project 3: AI Chatbot for Cooperative Education (in progress)
- 🤖 **Description**:  
  Developing an AI-powered chatbot to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the cooperative education program in the Faculty of Informatics.

- 🧠 **Features**:
  - Natural language understanding with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for accurate and up-to-date responses
  - Integration with **LINE Messaging API** for real-time interaction with students
  - Automated data flow using **n8n** for fetching documents, scheduling updates, and logging questions

- ⚙️ **Tech Stack**:
  - `n8n` (workflow automation)
  - `LINE Messaging API`
  - `OpenAI / LLM API` (for RAG)
  - `Pinecone / FAISS` (vector search)
  - Google Sheets / Docs as knowledge base sources

- 📌 **Goals**:
  - Reduce repetitive workload for admin staff
  - Provide students with 24/7 access to cooperative education information
  - Collect chat logs to improve future responses and identify knowledge gaps
